# COVID SAS Project
This repository builds a COVID Data Brief.

## Introduction:
At the beginning of 2020, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 spread across the globe, resulting in a pandemic. The virus continued to spread within the United States in June 2020. This data brief describes trends in confirmed cases and hospitalization rates in the United States. The data originates from a study completed in the first week of June from June 1 through June 7, 2020 at the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins . The data brief examines the trends in confirmed cases, new confirmed cases per day, and the average hospitalization rate at the national, regional , and state or territory levels. Data is available for the 50 U.S. states, six territories, and two cruise ships.

## Data Source:
